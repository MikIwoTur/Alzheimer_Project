# Alzheimer_Project

In this project we present the prediction and analyzation of Alzheimer's disease. We used multiple methods to describe open-source table of examined individuals.

The project is presented in python coding language with the use of additional libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and umap.

The code itself presents the analyzation of approximately 2600 patients that were examined to discus the Alzheimer's symptoms. In this project we tested the resulting data form the examination, and found the correlations between the criteria. Whole process was done in Google Colabolatory with the use of Pyhton 3 CPU. There are to versions of repository Polish and English writen veriosns. Polish one is named: Alzheimer_Project.ipynb, English version is named: Alzheimer_Project(English).ipynb
